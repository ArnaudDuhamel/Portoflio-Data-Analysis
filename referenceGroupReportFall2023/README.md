# Reference Group Report for the fall 2022 course Graphics Programming at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) 

## Context

At NTNU, professors must have a mechanism for student feedback for the courses they teach. In most courses, a reference group is used. 
This is a committee of about 2 to 3 students that meet with the professor at the start of the semester, in the middle and at the end,
to discuss how the course is doing. 

At the end of the course, the reference group has to write a report that is to be used for the next edition of the course.

## Task

Make the point that too little resources are invested into the course "Graphics Programming" compared to its difficulty level

## Data used

- Statistics about passed and failed obligatory assignments of courses I took since fall 2021
- Statistics about exams and graded assignments of courses I took since fall 2021

These statistics are available in an interface called "Studentweb" that active students can access to see their grades.
  
- Data about course and lab schedules available on the NTNU interface called "Timeplan"

Screenshots of the data have been taken and are included below. 

## Data cleaning

No cleaning was needed

## Data analysis

### Failing rate in each course that I took since 2021

To determine the number of students in a course, I added together the number of students that passed mandatory assignments with those that failed.
This does not included students that dropped out of the course without doing the assignments. 

To determine the number of students that failed, I added students that failed the mandatory assignments with those that failed the exam and/or the graded assignments.

The two following tables have been included in the report:
